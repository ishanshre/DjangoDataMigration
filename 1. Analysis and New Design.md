# Problem Statement
        Our web application, originally developed for small-scale businesses, has experienced
    rapid growth in recent months, resulting in a significant increase in the number of
    registered customers. As a result, we are facing challenges related to database
    performance, customer data management, and enhancing customer engagement. Your
    task is to address these challenges by implementing specific improvements in our
    backend using Python Django.
    Current Registered user field consists of ;
    - Username
    - Fullname
    - Birth of date (b.o.d)
    - Email
    - Ph number
    Approx current user registered : 1 million users

# Analysis of Current Database
    - The given fields in problem statement are attributes of the User Table.
      - Username: It is a string data type. It is unique type
      - Fullname: It is also a string data type that holds registered user full name.
      - BirthDate(D.O.B): It is a date data type that holds users birth date
      - Email: It is also a string data type that holds user's email address
      - Ph number: It is string data type that holds user's phone number

# Improvement on User Model
    - Username: This field should be unique to each user and indexed for efficient retrieval. The maximum length of username should be 25 characters long as username must be sweet, simple and easy to remember.
    - Full_name: This field varchar type and hold maximum length of 100 characters
    - Date_of_birth: This field should be of Date data type. This field should be indexed for efficient data retrieval. Real use case, sending bulk birthday email messages to user.
    - Email: This field should be of varchar data type with 255 max length. This field should be unique to user and indexed for better query optimization.
    - Phone_number: This models should be varchar with maximum of 15 characters. 
    - Joined_at: This is a timestamp field for user registration tracking.
    - Updated_at: This is a timestamp field for user updates tracking.

# Other Improvements (Customer Enagements)
    - Use Profile table to store additional user information like Bio, Avatar, et cetera. This table is linked with user table in a one to one relationship.
    - A seprate Address Table linked with User in a Foreign Key relationship. So a user can have one or more addresses
    - An activity table for keeping track of users. It is also linked with User table in foreign key relationship
    - A notification table that is used to notify user with messages
    - Other database tables such as friendship table, follower table, chat table and so on

# Database Scaling:
    - Upgrading the database server to handle the increased load.

# Caching
    - Implement caching mechanism like Redis or Memcache to reduce database loads
